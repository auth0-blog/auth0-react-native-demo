# Completed project for _Get Started with Auth0 Authentication in React Native Android Apps_ and _Get Started with Auth0 Authentication in React Native iOS Apps_


## Project Description

This project is the completed app for the following [Auth0 Developer Blog](https://auth0.com/blog/developers/) articles:

* [_Get Started with Auth0 Authentication in React Native Android Apps_](get-started-auth0-authentication-react-native-android)
* [_Get Started with Auth0 Authentication in React Native iOS Apps_](get-started-auth0-authentication-react-native-ios)

These articles walk the reader through the process of adding [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) authentication to Android and iOS apps build using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

The resulting app has these screens:

1. The _**Login**_ screen, which the user will see when the app launches. It has a **Login With Auth0** button that takes the user to the _Universal Login_ screen when pressed.
2. The _**Universal Login**_ screen, where the user authenticates themself — that is, where they enter their user name and password or perform some other action to prove their identity. You don’t have to code this screen; a call to the Auth0 API brings it up. After logging in, the app takes the user to the _Loading_ screen. 
3. The _**Loading**_ screen displays an activity indicator while the app determines the user’s login status. In many cases, the user won’t even see this screen.  
4. The _**Account**_ screen, where the user goes if they log in successfully. It displays a picture of the user and the user’s name and a **Logout** button that takes them to the _Login_ screen when pressed.

The Android version’s screens look like this:
